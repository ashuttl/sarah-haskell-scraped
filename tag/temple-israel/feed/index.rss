				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://wovenvoices.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The “Woven Voices: Messages from the Heart”</a> project continues to grow and to captivate the attention of many individuals and communities. To date there have been close to 1,800 messages received and read out loud in Market Square, Portsmouth. Over 400 prayer flag have been woven by over 50 volunteers. These prayer flags hang from Italy to Indonesia, Africa to Oakland, CA and from New York to New  Delhi, and more. I continue to learn personal and creative lessons as I extend this project into its third year. Check out the <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/wovenvoices/">Woven Voices section</a> on this website or the <a href="http://wovenvoices.blogspot.com" target="_blank">project blog</a> to read the latest news and learn how to participate.

This past year has been quite busy with travel, new works of art, teaching, residencies, commissions and graduate course work. One highlight was a trip to Bali in June which I have written about in my two blogs, <a href="http://macomberloomsandme.blogspot.com/2010_06_01_archive.html" target="_blank">Macomber Looms and Me </a>and <a href="http://wovenvoices.blogspot.com/2010_07_01_archive.html" target="_blank">Woven Voices</a>.

<div style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zF80bd8NRiw/TEEI4VMnU5I/AAAAAAAAAws/o8ETHMU0Ak4/s1600/DSC03892.jpg" alt="weaving tradtional doubvle Ikat" width="198" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">In the small village of  Tenganan Pegringsingan, Kadek supports her family by weaving on this simple loom</p></div>

While in Bali, I had the opportunity to meet a few weavers. One special visit was to Ni Kadek Trisnawati a traditional ikat weaver in the village of Tenganan Pegringsingan. She is from a long lineage of weavers, and uses the loom that her  grandfather built.

<div id="attachment_38" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03146.jpg" rel="lightbox[36]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38 " src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03146-180x240.jpg" alt="Portsmouth NH Overnight Art Summer 2010" width="180" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Caught Between Us&quot;, Public art installation on the Hanover St. parking Garage</p></div>

Another highlight of this spring was the installation of my large public art piece &#8220;Caught Between Us&#8221;.  This piece, inspired by the idea that the water that separates the shores of New Hampshire and Maine is also what unites us, was a part of the city of <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20100602-NEWS-100609966" target="_blank">Portsmouth, NH&#8217;s OverNight Art event</a>.  This site-specific work pays homage to the men and women who work on the Piscataqua River, the marine life that inhabits these waters, and the Memorial Bridge, which connects the communities of the Seacoast.

<div style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03133.jpg" rel="lightbox[36]"><img src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03133-180x240.jpg" alt="Detail of &quot;Caught Between Us&quot;" width="180" height="235" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detail of &quot;Caught Between Us&quot;</p></div>

Built from fish and shrimp nets, this piece references the web of life and the net-like construction of the bridge. The title, “Caught Between Us,” evokes the uncertain future of the Memorial Bridge as well as the fragility of our marine environment.

Also this summer I completed and installed a large woven commission for the <a href="http://www.templeisraelnh.org/" target="_blank">Temple Israel of Portsmouth</a>.  This piece titled &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221;  was commissioned to celebrate the life of <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090117-PUBLICRECORDS-901170314" target="_blank">Kathy Krasker Ramras</a>. This piece, hand dyed hand woven linen and four feet by seven feet was installed and dedicated on July 16th.

I have not yet had the opportunity to get this piece professional photographed&#8230;so please forgive my amateur attempt to capture this magnificent piece.

And finally I am having a one person show this fall at<a href="http://www.mainefiberarts.org/" target="_blank"> Maine Fiberarts. &#8220;Thread by Thread&#8221;</a> is up until November 30th. I am delighted to have this opportunity to gather art works from the past 20 years and exhibit them in one show.  Come to the reception and artist talk on November 6th.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/2010/10/whats-now/">Autumn 2010 ~ Colors in my studio</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com">Sarah Haskell</a>.</p>

The &#8220;Woven Voices: Messages from the Heart&#8221; project continues to grow  and to captivate the attention of many individuals and communities. In  August  I proudly received the &#8220;Sarah Farmer Peace Award&#8221; from the Seacoast  Baha&#8217;i Community.  Selected from several nominated organizations and individuals, I <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090819-NEWS-908190368" target="_blank">accepted the award</a> in recognition for my global art project, &#8220;Woven Voices: Messages from the Heart.&#8221;

This global art project continues to blossom and teach me lessons.  Please participate and join the thousands of voices that speak for peace through this project.  Check out the <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/wovenvoices/">Woven Voices section</a> on this website or the <a href="http://www.wovenvoices.blogspot.com/">project blog</a> to read the latest news and learn how to participate.

My residency and teaching work continues to blossom and expand.  I guided several major projects in schools this fall.  Check out the <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/educator/">Educator</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/mandala/">Mandala</a> sections of my website to see these in detail.  My education work continues to bring personal as well as professional rewards and lessons.

Back in my studio I am hard at work on several projects.  I recently completed a small commission for the Krempels Brain Injury  Foundation. Here is an image of the completed piece on my work table.  I am in the process of sewing it to the mounting board, getting it ready  for the frame.  The piece includes hand-spun colored paper with writings of good wishes  for the retiring executive director.

I am also working on a commission for the Temple Israel in Portsmouth.  This 4&#8242; by 7&#8242; Tree of Life weaving that will be dedicated and installed  in the temple lobby in the spring.  Here is a sneak preview of the piece on the loom.

This winter and spring I will be taking two courses towards my Masters in Art and Healing through <a href="https://www.wisdomuniversity.org/masters-art-healing.htm" target="_blank">Wisdom University</a>.  I am excited and ready to deepen my commitment to this work.

Besides this website and the Woven Voices blog, I also maintain a blog for Macomber Looms.  Check out <a href="http://macomberloomsandme.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">this blog</a> for all kinds of information about these hand-looms, built right here in York, Maine!

Please check out my gallery and send me a note with your thoughts about my work.  I appreciate hearing from you!

As ever, thank you for your interest and support of my artwork and teaching. I hope the beauty of this earth brings you joy.

Peace to all in this season of light and love,<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/2009/12/december-2009/">Season of Light and Love</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com">Sarah Haskell</a>.</p>
