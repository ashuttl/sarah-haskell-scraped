				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://wovenvoices.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The “Woven Voices: Messages from the Heart”</a> project continues to grow and to captivate the attention of many individuals and communities. To date there have been close to 1,800 messages received and read out loud in Market Square, Portsmouth. Over 400 prayer flag have been woven by over 50 volunteers. These prayer flags hang from Italy to Indonesia, Africa to Oakland, CA and from New York to New  Delhi, and more. I continue to learn personal and creative lessons as I extend this project into its third year. Check out the <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/wovenvoices/">Woven Voices section</a> on this website or the <a href="http://wovenvoices.blogspot.com" target="_blank">project blog</a> to read the latest news and learn how to participate.

This past year has been quite busy with travel, new works of art, teaching, residencies, commissions and graduate course work. One highlight was a trip to Bali in June which I have written about in my two blogs, <a href="http://macomberloomsandme.blogspot.com/2010_06_01_archive.html" target="_blank">Macomber Looms and Me </a>and <a href="http://wovenvoices.blogspot.com/2010_07_01_archive.html" target="_blank">Woven Voices</a>.

While in Bali, I had the opportunity to meet a few weavers. One special visit was to Ni Kadek Trisnawati a traditional ikat weaver in the village of Tenganan Pegringsingan. She is from a long lineage of weavers, and uses the loom that her  grandfather built.

<div id="attachment_38" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03146.jpg" rel="lightbox[36]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38 " src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03146-180x240.jpg" alt="Portsmouth NH Overnight Art Summer 2010" width="180" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Caught Between Us&quot;, Public art installation on the Hanover St. parking Garage</p></div>

Another highlight of this spring was the installation of my large public art piece &#8220;Caught Between Us&#8221;.  This piece, inspired by the idea that the water that separates the shores of New Hampshire and Maine is also what unites us, was a part of the city of <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20100602-NEWS-100609966" target="_blank">Portsmouth, NH&#8217;s OverNight Art event</a>.  This site-specific work pays homage to the men and women who work on the Piscataqua River, the marine life that inhabits these waters, and the Memorial Bridge, which connects the communities of the Seacoast.

<div style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03133.jpg" rel="lightbox[36]"><img src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2010/10/DSC03133-180x240.jpg" alt="Detail of &quot;Caught Between Us&quot;" width="180" height="235" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Detail of &quot;Caught Between Us&quot;</p></div>

Built from fish and shrimp nets, this piece references the web of life and the net-like construction of the bridge. The title, “Caught Between Us,” evokes the uncertain future of the Memorial Bridge as well as the fragility of our marine environment.

Also this summer I completed and installed a large woven commission for the <a href="http://www.templeisraelnh.org/" target="_blank">Temple Israel of Portsmouth</a>.  This piece titled &#8220;Tree of Life&#8221;  was commissioned to celebrate the life of <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090117-PUBLICRECORDS-901170314" target="_blank">Kathy Krasker Ramras</a>. This piece, hand dyed hand woven linen and four feet by seven feet was installed and dedicated on July 16th.

I have not yet had the opportunity to get this piece professional photographed&#8230;so please forgive my amateur attempt to capture this magnificent piece.

And finally I am having a one person show this fall at<a href="http://www.mainefiberarts.org/" target="_blank"> Maine Fiberarts. &#8220;Thread by Thread&#8221;</a> is up until November 30th. I am delighted to have this opportunity to gather art works from the past 20 years and exhibit them in one show.  Come to the reception and artist talk on November 6th.<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/2010/10/whats-now/">Autumn 2010 ~ Colors in my studio</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com">Sarah Haskell</a>.</p>
