The &#8220;Woven Voices: Messages from the Heart&#8221; project continues to grow  and to captivate the attention of many individuals and communities. In  August  I proudly received the &#8220;Sarah Farmer Peace Award&#8221; from the Seacoast  Baha&#8217;i Community.  Selected from several nominated organizations and individuals, I <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090819-NEWS-908190368" target="_blank">accepted the award</a> in recognition for my global art project, &#8220;Woven Voices: Messages from the Heart.&#8221;

This global art project continues to blossom and teach me lessons.  Please participate and join the thousands of voices that speak for peace through this project.  Check out the <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/wovenvoices/">Woven Voices section</a> on this website or the <a href="http://www.wovenvoices.blogspot.com/">project blog</a> to read the latest news and learn how to participate.

My residency and teaching work continues to blossom and expand.  I guided several major projects in schools this fall.  Check out the <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/educator/">Educator</a> and <a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/mandala/">Mandala</a> sections of my website to see these in detail.  My education work continues to bring personal as well as professional rewards and lessons.

Back in my studio I am hard at work on several projects.  I recently completed a small commission for the Krempels Brain Injury  Foundation. Here is an image of the completed piece on my work table.  I am in the process of sewing it to the mounting board, getting it ready  for the frame.  The piece includes hand-spun colored paper with writings of good wishes  for the retiring executive director.

I am also working on a commission for the Temple Israel in Portsmouth.  This 4&#8242; by 7&#8242; Tree of Life weaving that will be dedicated and installed  in the temple lobby in the spring.  Here is a sneak preview of the piece on the loom.

This winter and spring I will be taking two courses towards my Masters in Art and Healing through <a href="https://www.wisdomuniversity.org/masters-art-healing.htm" target="_blank">Wisdom University</a>.  I am excited and ready to deepen my commitment to this work.

Besides this website and the Woven Voices blog, I also maintain a blog for Macomber Looms.  Check out <a href="http://macomberloomsandme.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">this blog</a> for all kinds of information about these hand-looms, built right here in York, Maine!

Please check out my gallery and send me a note with your thoughts about my work.  I appreciate hearing from you!

As ever, thank you for your interest and support of my artwork and teaching. I hope the beauty of this earth brings you joy.

Peace to all in this season of light and love,<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/2009/12/december-2009/">Season of Light and Love</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com">Sarah Haskell</a>.</p>
