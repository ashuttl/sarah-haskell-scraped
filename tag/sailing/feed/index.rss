I am back home from a month of sailing on the coast of Maine.

<div id="attachment_1627" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_3714.jpg" rel="lightbox[1620]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1627" src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_3714-240x180.jpg" alt="Witness at Merchants Row" width="240" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Witness at Merchants Row</p></div>

We have a 30&#8242; sloop named Witness &#8211; actually she is the third boat named Witness that we have owned. For over 30 years I have sailed these waters with some awareness of the connection between sailing and observing/seeing.

<div id="attachment_1624" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_3810.jpg" rel="lightbox[1620]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1624" src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_3810-240x140.jpg" alt="August sailing journal" width="240" height="140" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">August sailing journal</p></div>

But this summer, after four weeks of living aboard, I think I finally &#8220;got it.&#8221; What I came to understand is that these weeks have been literally about just seeing &#8211; observing and witnessing.

Prior to heading out to sea I packed a pile of drawing supplies, three journals, paper to write on, to draw on and paint on. I packed paper to spin along with my drop spindle. I packed needles and linen thread. I packed scissors and a knife. I packed several books to read. I also packed a small iPad with headphones and the reference guides to the energy work I am studying. I was prepared to be busy and fully occupied.

<div id="attachment_1630" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_36761.jpg" rel="lightbox[1620]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1630" src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_36761-180x240.jpg" alt="Shifu spinning at sea" width="180" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shifu spinning at sea</p></div>

It quickly became clear the the muses of the ocean had other plans for my time and attention. When we were under way, either by sail or power, I used my full attention to navigate our course. A few times when we were at anchor I was able to draw in my journal or the ship&#8217;s log to document our cruise. Twice I used my spindle to spin paper into Shifu thread.

But for the most part either by choice or design &#8211; this past month I spent my time just looking. I observed the waves, the tides, the wind direction and speed, the motion of the lobster buoys, the seaweed, the porpoises and seals, quahogs and smooth granite ledges.

I heard the cry of an eagle, the huff of a harbor seal, the thwack of the halyard and the hum of an outboard motor. I smelled rotten fish, dewy evergreens, stinky boots and diesel fumes.

<div id="attachment_1625" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_3740.jpg" rel="lightbox[1620]"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1625" src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_3740-240x180.jpg" alt="Vinalhaven sunset" width="240" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Vinalhaven sunset</p></div>

But mostly I saw the beauty of the natural world that my heart was thirsty for.

I saw a deep connection between my husband and myself.

<div id="attachment_1634" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_37331.jpg" rel="lightbox[1620]"><img class="wp-image-1634 size-medium" src="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/files/2017/09/IMG_37331-240x180.jpg" alt="Thru the eyes of a puppy" width="240" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thru the eyes of a puppy</p></div>

I saw life through the eyes of a puppy.

I&#8217;ll admit it is really wonderful to be home where it is dry and warm. And it&#8217;s wonderful to be back in my studio with room to make art. But all this feels deeper and richer for the past month of simply witnessing aboard &#8220;Witness.&#8221;<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com/2017/09/i-see/">I see</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sarahhaskell.com">Sarah Haskell</a>.</p>
